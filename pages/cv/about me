I am a generalist who loves working with startups and small teams.

I moved to Beijing at age 25 with my then fiancee where after some intensive networking I met my co-founder and together we started MadeiraCloud where I served as CEO. After raising angel funding I successfully negotiated a $1.5 million dollar series A round from Sequoia Capital.
